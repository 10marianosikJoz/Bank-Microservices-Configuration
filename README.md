# Microservice Architecture Configuration Repository
## Overview
This dedicated repository stores configuration for a microservice-based system.
All configuration data is retrieved by a Configuration Server that serves as a centralized management point for application settings across the microservice ecosystem.

## Purpose
* Centralized management of all service configurations
* Environment-specific configuration profiles
* Version control and change history for all configuration changes
* Ability to update configurations without rebuilding or redeploying services
